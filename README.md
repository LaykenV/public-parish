# Public Parish

Public Parish is a free, open-source, nonpartisan application that helps
Louisiana residents see consequential local-government decisions, inspect the
official evidence, ask questions, follow an issue, and learn what happened after
the vote.

This repository was created for the
[Convex All Gas Hackathon](https://www.convex.dev/hackathons/all-gas). It is a
fresh application. The existing Lafayette ITEP project contributes evidence and
revision principles, not code or a submission base.

## Current state

The planned feature build is complete through Slice 9. Residents can explore
published decisions and issue timelines, inspect immutable official evidence,
ask grounded questions, and manage Google or verified-email follows. Sourced
alerts, grounded email replies, weekly roundups, private source reports,
coverage requests, verified launch notices, and issue share HTML are deployed.
Published history and corpus Ask work in batches as the corpus grows.

All twelve named launch bodies passed production coverage gates. Lafayette,
Rapides, and East Baton Rouge are available for those bodies' approved agendas
and minutes. The original seven bodies have automatic checks enabled. The five
newly certified Lafayette planning bodies still need owner-started updates.
Initial catch-up remains budget-paused. See the [September 6 operations
report](docs/source-operations-2026-09-06.md) for counts and limits.

[Current build status](docs/build-status.md) names the supported bodies, approved
limits, release proof, and remaining resident and submission work. The latest
application release passed 486 CI tests, its production workflow, and independent
production smoke. Development and controlled release tests do not establish
organic resident benefit.

## Local setup

Requirements:

- Node.js 22
- npm 11
- a Convex account with access to the `public-parish` project

From a fresh clone:

```bash
npm ci
npx convex ai-files install
npx convex dev --once
npm run verify
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` to use the resident interface.
`npx convex dev --once` creates the ignored `.env.local` file. Copy
`.env.example` only when documenting variable names. Never commit real values.

The frontend runs on the laptop. The backend does not. `npm run dev` runs Vite
locally and keeps the personal Convex development deployment synchronized with
the current branch. The local UI, development database, actions, and file
storage all use that remote development deployment. It is one shared personal
development deployment, not one deployment per branch. After switching
branches, run `npm run dev` so the remote backend matches the checked-out code.

Useful commands:

```bash
npm run dev:web
npm run dev:convex
npm run typecheck
npm run test
npm run build
npm run lint
npm run hosting:smoke:dev
npm run smoke:production
```

`npm run hosting:smoke:dev` builds with the development deployment URL and
uploads the result to that deployment's `convex.site` host. Use it only when a
change needs the real static host. Production builds fail when
`VITE_CONVEX_URL` is missing.

These setup and validation commands are for human contributors. Agents follow
`AGENTS.md`: automated validation runs in GitHub Actions unless the owner
approves the exact local command.

Pull requests run `npm run verify`. Every push to `main`, including an explicitly
authorized direct documentation push, triggers the `Deploy production`
workflow. It verifies that exact commit, runs `npm run deploy` to publish the
matching backend and frontend, applies the idempotent source-registry seed, and
runs `npm run smoke:production`. The smoke checks the direct `convex.site`, the
canonical custom domain, the apex redirect, and the production readiness query.

The bare-domain redirect is isolated in
[`infra/apex-redirect`](infra/apex-redirect/README.md). It preserves paths and
query strings but never hosts the application frontend. The hackathon submission
URL remains the public `convex.site` host; the custom domain is an additional
resident-facing entry point.

There is no staging environment during the hackathon. Test branches with the
local UI and personal development backend. Use a preview deployment only when
auth, webhook, routing, or schema work genuinely needs isolation.

## Implemented setup and intended stack

- TanStack Start in SPA/static-prerender mode
- Convex backend and realtime queries, with static hosting registered
- Firecrawl for official-source discovery, retrieval, PDFs, and change detection
- `@convex-dev/workflow` for the private prepare, extract, validate, and complete
  pipeline
- Convex AI Gateway for OpenAI Chat Completions with strict structured outputs
- `openai/gpt-5.6-terra` for record extraction, consequence factors, and issue
  linking; `openai/gpt-5.6-luna` for discovery classification, ranking,
  independent review, and chat
- Convex Auth v2 alpha with Google OAuth
- AgentMail for verified email subscriptions, inbound threads, and
  material-change alerts

Direct dependencies and the lockfile use exact versions. Convex Auth v2 is
pinned to `2.0.0-alpha.1` and owns Google sessions for saved resident setup.
Terra extraction and Luna review have passed real development and production
decision cases.
