# Public Parish Plan

Current status: Slice 9 is complete. See [build status and remaining work](docs/build-status.md)
for the September 6 documentation checkpoint. Dated sections below retain their
original release context; they do not reopen completed feature work.

Status: Phase 0, evidence-engine Slices 1 through 4, resident-interface Design Slices 1 through 8, and implementation Slices 6 through 8 are deployed; Slice 9 is deployed and production-tested
Event: Convex All Gas Hackathon
Submission deadline: September 22, 2026 at 12:00 PM Pacific

The production backend stores immutable official-source snapshots, extracts and
deterministically validates cited atomic decisions, runs a separate independent
review, and writes full, limited, or withheld immutable publication versions.
The first issue-link and importance proof ran in the personal development
deployment. PR #12 deployed the hardened Slice 3 backend as `8df651c`. PR #13
deployed Slice 4 as `c162543`; production workflow `33273984552` and the
independent production smoke passed. The controlled launch-data batch then
published 26 cited atomic records after Terra extraction, Luna review, and
deterministic policy: 15 Lafayette, 9 Rapides, and 2 East Baton Rouge records.
Fifteen are full and 11 are limited. Three targets stayed out after exact-citation
validation failures, and one negative control returned `not_found`. The
resident integration reads current full and limited atomic publications and
accepted issue timelines through bounded public queries. The approved resident
information architecture uses one issue-led Home. It shows accepted Lafayette
and Rapides issue timelines first, then the atomic decision records underneath.
Explore searches issues before decision records. The old `/for-you` and
`/issues` index routes redirect to Home, while issue detail routes remain
stable. Withheld versions stay hidden. Publication counts do not prove complete
body coverage.

Resident-interface Design Slice 1 established the complete route blueprint.
Design Slice 2 then shipped the responsive shell plus fixture-backed Home, For
You, and Explore pages through PR #24 as `4e2ac67`. Explicit fixture URL
scenarios remain available for deterministic QA in development builds. The
resident pages do not show a fixture banner, and production ignores fixture
parameters instead of presenting fixture records. PR #25 deployed the owner
phone-review refinements as `b22e321`, including structured card headers and
status pills, Coss action treatments, one-color Watching text, and a Louisiana
Coverage icon. Production workflow `33324166404` and the independent smoke
passed. The current integration replaces the production discovery empty states
with accepted atomic records.

PR #27 deployed Design Slice 3 as `3a59e45`. It implemented the issue, atomic
decision, meeting, and citation-level evidence surfaces. Its explicit typed
fixtures load only through development-only imports, add no resident-facing
banner, and stay out of production JavaScript. At that design checkpoint,
production routes showed an honest recovery page until the real detail queries
arrived.

PR #28 merged resident-interface Design Slice 4 as `ff36c1b`. Its production
workflow `33389489990` succeeded. That design release resolved corpus, issue,
and meeting scope through a typed adapter, rendered cited answers in the
existing evidence gutter, and moved the resident's question out of the URL into
an in-memory handoff. It deliberately kept production Ask unavailable until the
implementation Slice 6 backend passed. Eleven presentation scenarios load only
through a development-only dynamic import.

PR #31 deployed Design Slice 5 as `adfe81e`. Production workflow `33401768387`
and the independent production smoke passed. The fixture-backed follow and
ownership interface covers Google return, email-only verification, Following,
areas and topics, notification preferences, scoped email management, and alert
layouts. At that design checkpoint, the production routes remained unavailable
until Convex Auth and AgentMail passed their integration gates.

PR #34 deployed Design Slice 6 as `0aa7474`, including Coverage, coverage
requests, the public method page, area states, and private source-problem
reporting. PR #37 deployed Design Slice 7 as `f854c2e` and made route focus,
loading, sheets, live announcements, and reduced motion consistent across the
application. PR #43 deployed the final connected prototype as `85d6947`.
Production workflow `33454522729` and the independent production smoke passed.
The final UI carries development evidence scenarios and bounded return routes
across discovery, records, Ask, Following, and Coverage without exposing
fixtures in production.

The resident UI design track is complete. The full production resident loop is
not. The resident-evidence integration connects current accepted decisions,
grouped meeting evidence, exact citations, and fail-closed issue subscriptions
to the finished routes. Production issue runs
`jd7eeb84pv1rzdmp6jf3dg161d8djvz0` and
`jd76dkmjgyz6rf4temt03cefgx8dj27m` passed linking, independent review,
deterministic validation, and publication. A subscriber received the second
issue on its existing connection 10.8 seconds after an initial empty result.
The Slice 5 data gate is closed.

Implementation Slice 6 is also closed. PR #45 deployed private 24-hour Agent
threads as `c9ea441`, PR #47 deployed validated `MODEL_FAST` answers as
`9ae0467`, and PR #49 deployed the bounded anonymous Ask interface as
`30dc267`. PR #56 then deployed the high-reasoning Luna selector and answer
flow as `adc0a34` through production workflow `33560561545`. The selector sees
every current issue, meeting, decision, and accepted citation excerpt in scope.
Deterministic code expands its targets, and the answer pass receives those
records plus their hash-checked normalized official documents. Invalid, broad,
and empty selections expand to the full scope. A valid not-found selection
returns the safe not-found answer without running the document-heavy second
call. Per-session and app-wide request-frequency limits remain. Provider token
use is private telemetry, not an application-owned input or output budget. Hard
record-count and document-byte checks fail visibly instead of truncating model
context.

Production tests proved both issue and corpus Ask. The issue flow completed two
related cited turns and opened the exact `CO-022-2026` and `CO-023-2026`
minutes spans. The corpus flow selected both surplus-pickup decisions and named
Terrebonne Parish Consolidated Government from the accepted evidence. PR #57
deployed the citation-display correction as `13f735b` through workflow
`33562735003`; a fresh production answer showed resident-facing Source controls
without raw internal evidence IDs. Implementation Slice 7A is deployed through
PRs #58 and #59. Google account ownership, private saved areas and topics,
centralized authorization, and the public privacy notice are live. Production
browser tests completed Google sign-in and sign-out from the canonical domain
and from the qualifying `convex.site` origin through the canonical callback.
Implementation Slice 7B is deployed through PRs #66 and #67. Google residents
and AgentMail-verified email-only residents can now follow an issue, topic,
government body, or place, and each can manage only their own follow. Coverage
requests are live in production after Slice 9.
Implementation Slice 7C is deployed through PRs #72 through #75. Accepted new
decisions and later material changes now create durable follow matches,
deduplicated immediate delivery, evidence-only weekly roundups, and live
notification settings. A controlled development replay sent two immediate and
two weekly messages through AgentMail and produced no duplicate on replay. PR
#57 already corrected the Markdown emphasis markers found during controlled
corpus QA. Implementation Slice 7D is deployed through PRs #78 and #79. It
verifies an alert's inbox, thread, and sender before reusing the grounded Ask
path for replies. It also sends private source-problem reports through a
separate AgentMail inbox without starting Firecrawl, extraction, or publication
work. Production workflows `33786995126` and `33788197489` passed for merge
commits `3f18c126` and `41a6d593`, followed by independent production smokes.
PRs #81 through #83 then made weekly replies cover every roundup item, retained
private-report delivery results beyond AgentMail payload cleanup, and stopped
body and place alerts when coverage is no longer supported or degraded. Their
production workflows `33797222889`, `33797505992`, and `33797772856` passed,
followed by independent production smokes. A controlled production source
report reached `sent`, retained that terminal status in the application, and
left the latest evidence-pipeline run unchanged. At that checkpoint, the full alert-and-reply
provider round trip had development proof only. Slice 9 later verified the
controlled production round trip; organic resident benefit remains unproven.

Implementation Slice 8 is closed. PRs #85 through #88 deployed the
owner-controlled compiler, bounded Firecrawl discovery, strict source
classification, exact-sample validation, ten deterministic coverage gates,
promotion controls, and the private operations view. PR #91 replaced the slot
template with checked artifact fixtures and ran the complete evidence lifecycle.
Production certification promoted Alexandria City Council, Pineville City
Council, Rapides Parish Police Jury, Baton Rouge Metropolitan Council, and Baton
Rouge Planning and Zoning Commission after each passed all ten gates. PR #92 connected the
area selector to the live jurisdiction projection. Rapides and East Baton Rouge
became available. Lafayette stayed validating at that checkpoint because its
planning bodies lacked meeting-specific agenda and outcome evidence. All five
planning bodies passed production certification on September 6, so Lafayette
is now available for its seven named launch bodies. The compiler is an
onboarding and repair operation. Routine scheduled source checks, automatic
document-to-decision fanout, and new issue proposals were outside Slice 8.
Slice 9 subsequently deployed them under bounded owner-approved policies.

## Executive Decision

Enter the hackathon with Public Parish, a fresh application built around one
complete resident outcome:

> See what local government is about to change, understand the official evidence,
> ask a question, follow the issue, and learn what happened.

This is a justified four-week exception to the normal business plan because the
founder has previously won this Convex hackathon, cares about the domain, has
credible local distribution, and can turn the work into a public case study.
It is not a substitute for selling Varholdt services. The weekday 90-minute
sales block, partner outreach, and first-dollar goals remain protected.

The project can be broad in capability without becoming broad in promise. It
will launch with defined bodies in three Louisiana regions, use a dynamic
coverage compiler instead of hand-coding every portal, and hold every supported
place to one evidence standard. The product will not claim statewide coverage.

## Winning Thesis

The project is strong enough to contend if the submission proves all of these at
once:

1. A normal resident can use it immediately, without learning government jargon.
2. It operates on real, current Louisiana records across more than one portal
   shape.
3. Every meaningful statement has an official-source receipt and visible
   uncertainty.
4. Firecrawl, OpenAI, AgentMail, and Convex each perform essential work in one
   live workflow.
5. A source change becomes a validated update, a realtime interface change, and
   a useful email alert.
6. Real residents use the product before judging.
7. The demo shows the product doing the work instead of describing future scope.

The winning version is not “AI summarizes council meetings.” It is a live civic
evidence system that connects a resident, a consequential issue, the official
record, a question, a change, and an outcome.

## Problem

Louisiana local-government information exists, but it is split across agenda
centers, document searches, PDFs, minutes, ordinances, calendars, and videos.
Residents usually encounter a controversy after the important deadline or must
read an entire meeting packet to understand one item.

The missing layer connects:

- the issue a resident cares about;
- the granular decisions and meetings that move it;
- what changed and when;
- the official evidence for each claim;
- what the public can still do;
- the final decision and later implementation.

## Product Promise

Public Parish is free, open source, nonpartisan, source-cited, and correctable.
It tells residents what a supported local body is considering, why a decision
may matter, when action is expected, how to inspect the original record, and
what happened next.

It does not tell residents what political position to take. "Why this may matter"
describes cited effects on public money, public assets, land use, health and
safety, rights and access, service delivery, and public deadlines. It does not
use outrage, popularity, or the founder's opinion as a ranking signal.

## Launch Coverage

### Lafayette Parish

- Lafayette City Council
- Lafayette Parish Council
- Youngsville City Council
- Lafayette planning and zoning bodies

### Rapides Parish

- Alexandria City Council
- Pineville City Council
- Rapides Parish Police Jury
- relevant planning and zoning bodies after official-source discovery

### East Baton Rouge Parish

- Metropolitan Council
- Planning Commission

All three regions receive the same public trust standard. Their source adapters
and body structures can differ. The internal coverage compiler may discover and
validate a new jurisdiction, but it does not make that jurisdiction public until
its source set passes the coverage gate. The public coverage-request form only
records demand and an optional notification address. It never starts a crawl.

## Core Resident Experience

### 1. Choose What Is Local

The resident selects a parish or municipality and optional topics. No street
address is requested. Signed-in users can save multiple areas.

### 2. Discover Issues and Decisions

The home experience has:

- **Issue timelines:** related decisions for the resident's selected areas;
- **Latest decision records:** the atomic government actions beneath those
  issues, including records without a validated issue relationship;
- **Explore:** issue-first search across every published issue and decision
  record.

### 3. Understand an Issue

An issue page connects the underlying proposal, hearing, agenda item, amendment,
vote, contract, and outcome when the official record supports that relationship.
It shows:

- a plain-language explanation;
- "Why this may matter" factors with citations;
- current stage and next known date;
- remaining public actions and deadlines;
- a chronological decision timeline;
- exact citations and original sources;
- last-checked time, confidence, and coverage health;
- source revisions and published fixes.

Atomic decisions remain available. Uncertain relationships remain separate.

### 4. Ask Public Parish

Anonymous visitors can hold a multi-turn chat about the current issue or any
published Public Parish evidence. The same device keeps continuity for 24 hours.
Chat never requires sign-in and never searches the open web for civic facts.

When the validated corpus does not answer a question, Public Parish says that the
answer was not found and links the relevant official contact or source. It does
not improvise.

### 5. Follow and Receive an Outcome

Accounts are optional. Google accounts provide saved interests and managed
follows. A resident who does not want an account can verify an email-only
subscription through AgentMail. Either owner can follow an issue, topic, body,
or place. AgentMail sends immediate material-change alerts and an
optional weekly roundup of material updates.

Material changes include a new decision, amendment, deadline, meeting change,
vote, contract award, implementation update, or outcome.

### 6. Inspect Coverage and Report a Source Problem

A public coverage page shows bodies, source health, last successful check, and
known limits. A resident can report a wrong fact, broken citation, or missed
official source through a dedicated AgentMail address. Reports stay private and
do not start an automated workflow. The owner may rerun the normal evidence
pipeline. If the accepted public record changes, the issue's normal revision
history shows the fix.

### 7. Find Voting Information

The landing page carries one small, dated voter-information strip: the next
statewide election date and an outbound link to the Louisiana Secretary of
State's official voter portal for registration status and a resident's sample
ballot.

The strip is static hand-authored content. It runs no crawl, no extraction, and
no model call. It names no candidate, party, office, or position, and it ranks
nothing. Public Parish points at the official voter portal instead of restating
what that portal already publishes, so the strip sits outside the publication
contract without weakening it.

Confirm the election date against the Secretary of State's official calendar
before the strip goes live. Do not write the date from memory. Remove or advance
the strip once that date passes.

## Government Record Model

The system extracts granular records such as proposals, hearings, votes,
contracts, appointments, and public actions. It can connect them into an issue
timeline with these lifecycle states:

1. discovered
2. proposed
3. scheduled
4. amended
5. postponed
6. decided
7. implementing
8. completed
9. canceled
10. unknown

The pipeline extracts all useful official records for completeness and search.
Promotion to the main feeds requires a substantive decision and a valid
importance assessment.

## Sponsor Roles

| Provider  | Essential responsibility                                                                                                              | Visible proof                                                |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Convex    | Evidence graph, workflow state, source versions, live queries, AI Gateway, chat state, follows, schedules, Auth v2 alpha, and hosting | A validated source change updates the resident UI live       |
| Firecrawl | Maps official sites, discovers sources, retrieves pages and PDFs, renders difficult pages, parses documents, and detects change       | A new or changed government artifact enters the pipeline     |
| OpenAI    | Produces strict structured extraction, independent review, consequence factors, issue-link proposals, and grounded answers            | The app turns a source packet into cited records and answers |
| AgentMail | Persists civic email threads and sends material-change and outcome alerts                                                             | A follower receives and can reply to a sourced update        |

No provider is present only for a logo or a trivial API call.

## Technical Direction

- Frontend: TanStack Start in SPA/static-prerender mode
- Hosting: Convex static hosting on a public `convex.site` URL
- Sharing: per-issue Open Graph HTML from a Convex HTTP route that reads only
  published issue data and points visitors to the canonical issue page
- Backend: Convex queries, mutations, actions, scheduling, HTTP actions, and
  realtime subscriptions
- Auth: pinned Convex Auth v2 alpha with Google OAuth
- Retrieval: Firecrawl through its Convex component
- Email: AgentMail through its Convex component, including verification of
  email-only alert subscriptions
- AI: OpenAI Chat Completions through Convex AI Gateway with strict
  `response_format` JSON schemas
- Models: `openai/gpt-5.6-terra` for record extraction, consequence factors,
  and issue linking; `openai/gpt-5.6-luna` for discovery classification,
  ranking, independent publication review, and chat
- Evidence: immutable source snapshots, content hashes, precise excerpts, PDF
  pages or sections, retrieval times, processing history, and published versions

See `docs/architecture.md` for the full design.

## Publication Contract

A claim may become public only when:

1. the source belongs to the body's approved official-domain registry;
2. an immutable source snapshot exists;
3. extraction returns the strict schema;
4. every material fact resolves to a citation in that snapshot;
5. deterministic checks pass for names, dates, amounts, links, and source
   versions;
6. an independent OpenAI review returns a valid verdict;
7. the final publication policy passes.

If the source is incomplete, the product shows “Limited information available”
or withholds the card. A second model call cannot turn absent evidence into a
fact.

## Success Scorecards

### Civic Proof

- 25 real residents use the live app
- 10 issue or topic follows
- 10 substantive chat questions
- several users return or open an update
- one real decision is followed from discovery through a later outcome
- zero published claims without a resolving citation

### Hackathon Proof

- fresh Convex application and public repository
- public `convex.site` app usable without an invite
- meaningful Convex, Firecrawl, OpenAI, and AgentMail integrations
- Convex AI Gateway and Auth v2 alpha working in the public app
- live source-change demonstration
- current root `hackathon.md`
- under-three-minute demo dominated by product interaction
- technical build posts on X or LinkedIn that tag all required sponsors
- submission on vibeapps.dev before the deadline

### Business Proof

Keep this separate from civic usage:

- qualified business conversations
- Workflow Diagnostics
- proposals
- deposits
- inbound requests from actual buyers or partners

Views, resident signups, and hackathon attention are not counted as business
leads.

## Distribution

- X and LinkedIn: technical build progress, sponsor integration, reliability,
  and hackathon story
- TikTok and Facebook: resident problem, official evidence, current local issue,
  and how to use Public Parish

One recording can produce separate edits. Content work is capped near 90 minutes
per week. Posts in local Facebook groups must follow group rules and identify the
builder transparently.

The product voice stays nonpartisan even when the surrounding issue is
controversial.

## Scope Guardrails

Do not build these before the complete loop is working and used:

- exact-address personalization;
- maps;
- public comments or discussion;
- testimony generation;
- public-records request automation;
- a separate procurement product;
- full meeting-video transcription;
- a municipal staff portal;
- every Louisiana parish;
- generic civic-platform configuration work.

The hackathon scope permanently excludes FAQ aggregation, a productized public
corrections workflow, public-triggered coverage compilation, live public
compiler progress, and cross-device chat history. It also permanently excludes candidate
profiles, ballot matching, and any district-level election feature. The
landing-page voter-information strip is the only election surface, and it makes
no claim of its own. Keep the public "Request your
parish" form as demand capture, and run the coverage compiler only from an
owner-controlled operation. Weekly roundup emails and per-issue dynamic share
HTML remain part of the planned product.

If schedule pressure appears, cut geographic breadth behind the public coverage
gate before weakening citation, review, source versioning, chat grounding, or the
end-to-end Lafayette demo.

## Post-Hackathon Rule

After submission, continue adding product features only if at least one of these
is true:

- residents repeatedly use alerts or return for outcomes;
- a named newsroom, civic group, or government body will distribute or verify
  the service;
- a qualified commercial opportunity emerges.

Otherwise, preserve Public Parish as a useful open-source civic service and a
strong technical case study, then return product time to the core business.


## Slice 9 completion

The final feature build is complete and deployed through the follow-up repairs
in PRs #102 through #108. [Current build status and remaining work](docs/build-status.md)
records the exact release, verification scope, named coverage, and operating
limits. [Production certification](docs/slice-9-production-certification.md)
preserves the initial release evidence. The [September 6 source-operations
report](docs/source-operations-2026-09-06.md) records subsequent certification,
automation, queue progress, and budget limits. Catch-up, future planning-source
automation, resident observations, the demo, and submission remain operating
work. No Slice 10 is planned.
