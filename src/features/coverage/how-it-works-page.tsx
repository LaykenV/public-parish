          <p>
            Public Parish turns official local-government records into
            resident-readable decisions. Every published fact stays attached to
            the exact official evidence that supports it.

            <p>
              Dates, money, deadlines, votes, and outcomes use written Source
              controls. A Source opens the exact excerpt, document title, page
              or section, and retrieval date.

              <h3>Find the official record</h3>
              <p>
                Public Parish monitors approved government domains and document
                hosts. News reports and social posts are not publication
                evidence.

            <div>
              <h3>Keep an unchanged source copy</h3>
              <p>
                Each retrieved page or file receives an immutable version so an
                older citation keeps resolving after the official source
                changes.

              <h3>Check every material fact</h3>
              <p>
                Dates, names, amounts, links, and excerpts pass deterministic
                checks. A separate review tests whether the cited words support
                the claim.

              <p>
                Complete evidence can publish a full record. Missing evidence
                produces limited information or no publication. A second model
                cannot fill a missing fact.

            <p>
              A government body must pass one common gate. Public Parish checks
              official domains, representative records, citations, source
              revisions, freshness expectations, and working document links.
            </p>

            <h3>Supported is earned</h3>
            <p>
              A place does not become supported because one document was found
              or one decision published.

            <h3>Dated records stay visible</h3>
            <p>
              When a source is delayed, the last accepted information remains
              visible with its date and a factual freshness warning.

          <p>
            Public Parish explains documented consequence, process, evidence,
            deadlines, and public actions. It does not tell residents what
            position to take and never ranks by outrage or popularity.

          <p>
            Reading and Ask do not require an account. Public Parish requests no
            street address. Routine questions, alert details, and source problem
            reports stay private.

            When the official record changes

          <p>
            A new accepted source can update an issue without erasing the older
            record. Material changes appear in Update history as a Government
            update, More information posted, or Public Parish correction.
          </p>
          <p>
            A private source report does not change a page by itself. The normal
            evidence process must accept official support for the correction.

            OpenAI calls run from Convex actions through Convex AI Gateway.
