# Resident interface Slice 1

Release status: this design document is a historical specification. Its resident
interfaces and required integrations shipped by Slice 9. See
[build status](build-status.md) for current behavior, remaining source work, and
the accepted desktop and mobile emulation scope. Fixture and physical-device
instructions below describe the original design review, not open build gates.

Status: deployed low-fidelity system; shell and discovery are superseded by Design Slice 2

Date: August 29, 2026

## Decision

Slice 1 is more than empty route files. It establishes the route graph, page
order, final control positions, responsive shell, overlay locations, shared
component vocabulary, and required states. It does not finish visual design or
connect an API.

The current marketing page remains at `/` inside the shared application shell.
Slice 2 owns its transition into the first-visit and returning resident Home.
This slice records both Home frames so that work cannot change the application
structure later.

Every routed screen in this slice uses local design data. Controls without a
real destination are intentionally inert. They cannot report a sent question,
follow, email, request, or source problem. Resident pages do not show fixture or
prototype banners.

Internal navigation uses TanStack Router links, so route changes exercise the
fixed loading region instead of reloading the document. The four-item bottom
navigation remains available through tablet widths and moves into the desktop
header above 64 rem. The email management token route keeps only the Public
Parish Home link and its scoped content. It does not render the application nav.

## Release boundary

PR #14 deployed this slice as `6e46fd7`. It exposed prototype routes and made no
working resident-action claim. Design Slice 2 has since
replaced the Home, For You, and Explore blueprints with their high-fidelity
fixture-backed implementations. The remaining blueprint routes keep inert
controls from reporting success without adding a page-top prototype banner.

## Design plan

### Subject

A Louisiana resident is trying to understand one consequential local decision
from official records. The interface is a civic utility with an editorial
reading order. It is not a government portal or a generic dashboard.

### Foundation

| Role           | Value     | Slice 1 use                                     |
| -------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Paper          | `#FAFAF9` | Page field                                      |
| Card           | `#FFFFFF` | Controls and state notes                        |
| Ink            | `#171717` | Identity, copy, primary actions                 |
| River blue     | `#315BEA` | Route blueprint marks and evidence relationship |
| Evidence green | `#10B981` | Reserved for confirmed evidence and success     |
| Warning amber  | `#F59E0B` | Reserved for limited and degraded states        |
| Muted ink      | `#686864` | Supporting copy                                 |

Inter carries navigation, headings, copy, and controls. Geist Mono carries
route parameters, dates, identifiers, and source metadata.

### Layout

The 375 pixel layout is one reading column with the final four-item bottom
navigation. The mark and product name in the top bar link to Home. State
contracts follow the page content in low fidelity. Above 48 rem, the state
contract moves to a narrow right rail. Above 64 rem, the mobile bottom
navigation becomes a desktop header.

The mobile and tablet top bar scrolls with the page. Only bottom navigation
stays fixed, so app chrome does not squeeze the reading window between two
pinned bars. The top bar is at most 3.5 rem and the bottom navigation is at most
4.25 rem before safe-area padding. Their controls keep 44-by-44-pixel targets.

The master widths are:

- shell: up to 80 rem;
- page heading and explanation: up to 48 rem;
- primary reading column: flexible, with a comfortable 55 to 72 character
  measure in later high-fidelity slices;
- state or evidence rail: 14 to 18 rem;
- mobile page gutter: 0.75 rem;
- tablet and desktop page gutter: 1.5 rem.

### Signature reservation

The evidence gutter is the only signature interaction. Slice 1 reserves a
river-blue evidence region beside Issue, Decision record, and Ask. On mobile,
the same Source action owns a bottom sheet. Slice 3 will design the excerpt,
connector rule, focus return, URL state, and official-document action.

Every mobile sheet opens from a written control. An open sheet has a grabber,
explicit Close control, safe backdrop dismissal, and downward drag dismissal.
Medium sheets may expand to full height. Closing returns to the exact opener.
The grabber never replaces Source, More filters, Follow, Choose area, or Report
a source problem.

### Anti-template review

The prototype avoids a hero and equal feature cards on application routes. It
does not use statistics, fake records, decorative pills, social signals,
government seals, campaign colors, or AI decoration. Dashed regions state
structure and fixture boundaries. They are not the final component treatment.

## Route and overlay map

```text
/
|-- /for-you
|-- /explore
|-- /ask
|-- /coverage
|   `-- /coverage/request
|-- /issues/:issueSlug
|-- /decisions/:recordKey
|-- /meetings/:meetingId
|-- /how-it-works
|-- /following
|   |-- /following/areas-and-topics
|   `-- /following/notifications
|-- /email/manage/:token
`-- route not found

Overlays and URL state
|-- area selector sheet or dialog
|-- mobile filter sheet
|-- desktop filter column
|-- evidence bottom sheet or desktop panel
|-- follow choice sheet or dialog
|   `-- email entry, code, and confirmation in one overlay
|-- private source-problem form
|-- confirmation for Unfollow all
`-- stable route-loading region owned above route content
```

`/share/issues/:slug` remains a Convex HTTP share page. It is not a resident SPA
screen. The private source-problem flow is an overlay, not a public discussion
route.

## Mobile interaction contract

- Preserve the nested route and scroll position for For You, Explore, Ask, and
  Coverage when switching destinations.
- Tapping the active destination scrolls its current page to the top.
- Let Safari own the screen-edge Back gesture. Do not swipe between top-level
  destinations.
- Use horizontal swipe only for finite issue rails. Keep part of the next card
  visible, use proximity snapping, and preserve vertical page scrolling.
- Do not add vertical page snapping or swipe-only management actions.
- Use the system share sheet when available and keep Copy link as the fallback.
- Apply safe-area insets to bottom navigation and sheet actions.
- Hide bottom navigation for the keyboard and full-height sheets.

The master plan defines starting sheet heights and the real-iPhone Safari
review that follows every deployed design slice.

## 375 pixel page frames

These frames establish reading order. Brackets mark controls. Braces mark
overlays or conditional regions.

Desktop expands the mobile reading order. It does not create a separate
dashboard hierarchy.

## Connected flow map

1. `/` area selection to major issue to Source viewer.
2. `/explore` filters to `/decisions/:recordKey` to related `/issues/:issueSlug`.
3. Issue Ask action to `/ask?issue=:issueSlug`, two questions, then Source viewer.
4. Issue Follow to delivery choice to Google return to the original issue.
5. Issue Follow to email entry to code to confirmed email-only follow.
6. Alert link to changed issue to What changed to Source viewer.
7. `/coverage` degraded row to `/coverage/request` and neutral confirmation.
8. Issue, decision, or meeting to private source-problem overlay and private
   confirmation.
9. Returning `/` skips the full hero and opens with Watching area plus feeds.
10. Keyboard navigation completes Explore filters, Source viewer, and Follow,
    with focus returning to each opener.

## Required state map

- Home: first visit, return visit, loading, empty, degraded, signed out, signed
  in, live update.
- Issue: full, limited, degraded, historical, succeeded by newer, not found,
  live update.
- Ask: empty, active, scoped, supported, not found, cooldown, expired, provider
  failure.
- Follow: signed out, Google choice, email entry, code, success, failure.
- Coverage: supported, degraded, validating, paused, not supported.
- Global: fixed route loading, offline, authentication expiry, section failure,
  and route not found.

## Conflicts and missing data contracts

1. The resident issue projection and direct public query do not exist yet.
   Slice 3 interface work must not read the private issue ledger.
2. Public issue succession needs an explicit projection field for the newer
   timeline link before historical routes can show it.
3. Meeting, public coverage, source expectation, and coverage incident
   projections remain planned.
4. Ask, Google auth, follow ownership, email verification, AgentMail alerts,
   notification preferences, and coverage requests need typed adapters before
   any control can report success.
5. The private source-problem form needs its AgentMail endpoint and attached
   public record URL contract.
6. The real development issue has no public production counterpart. It may
   stress layout in development, but it cannot appear as a production claim.
7. The voter-information strip needs a fresh official election-date check. It
   stays a reserved Home region until that check happens.
8. Route search contracts for Explore filters, Ask scope, citation selection,
   and overlay return state still need typed schemas.

None of these gaps changes the page hierarchy. If later API work does, return to
this slice before wiring it.

## Approval gate

PR #14 passed the repository and responsive checks for this gate and deployed as
`6e46fd7`. The route graph remains the contract for later slices. The founder's
real-iPhone Safari review remains a device check for the current Slice 2 shell;
it does not turn fixture-backed actions into production features.
