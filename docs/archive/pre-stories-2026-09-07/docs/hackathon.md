# Hackathon Requirements and Win Plan

Current status: Slice 9 is complete. See [build status and remaining work](build-status.md)
for the September 7 documentation checkpoint. Dated sections below retain their
original release context; they do not reopen completed feature work.

Official event:
[Convex All Gas Hackathon](https://www.convex.dev/hackathons/all-gas)

This document translates the event rules and judging criteria into Public Parish
acceptance criteria. Re-check the official page before submission in case the
organizers change a detail.

## Verified Event Facts

- Kickoff: August 25, 2026
- Submission deadline: September 22, 2026 at 12:00 PM Pacific
- Winners announced: September 25, 2026
- The app must have started on or after August 25 at 12:00 PM Pacific.
- It must be a new full-stack app with Convex as the backend.
- Firecrawl must feed application data.
- AgentMail must provide an inbox.
- The project must use Codex or another agent with the Convex plugin.
- The repository must be public.
- A root `hackathon.md` build log is required.
- The live app must be publicly accessible at a `convex.site` or
  `chatgpt.site` URL without an invite.
- Submission includes the public repo, live URL, and a video through
  [vibeapps.dev](https://vibeapps.dev/).
- The demo must be under three minutes.
- Builders should share on X or LinkedIn and tag `@convex`, `@OpenAI`,
  `@firecrawl`, and `@agentmail`.

The event page lists $10,000, $5,000, and $1,500 cash prizes, with additional
provider benefits. Contest results are uncertain. The build is justified by the
combined value of a useful public product, skill, distribution, credibility, and
prize probability.

## Custom domain and qualifying URL

The official event page was re-checked on August 27. It requires a public
`convex.site` or `chatgpt.site` URL that judges or an agent can open without an
invitation, and its submission checklist asks for a live URL on one of those
hosts. It does not state that an app cannot also use a custom domain.

Public Parish does not depend on that omission. Submit
`https://befitting-flamingo-587.convex.site` as the live app URL and keep it
functional through judging. It is the qualifying host and serves the production
application through Convex static hosting.

`https://publicparish.com` is a resident-facing entry point. Vercel handles only
its permanent redirect to `https://www.publicparish.com`; it does not host the
application frontend. Convex serves both the `www` custom domain and the
required `convex.site` origin from the same production HTTP router and static
release. The custom domain therefore supplements the required host instead of
replacing it.

## Setup and registration status

The official setup prompt was followed on August 26:

- read the Convex agent setup instructions;
- identified this environment as Codex with shell and project-local skill
  support;
- selected Convex static hosting after the user chose `convex.site`;
- added the `get-convex/convex-codex-plugin` marketplace;
- installed and enabled `convex@convex-codex-plugin` version 1.10.0;
- initialized this fresh Git repository;
- installed the official project-local hackathon logging skill files;
- did not install Convex project AI files because the repository is not yet a
  scaffolded Convex project.

The user completed Luma registration. Confirm that the Firecrawl account has
received the listed participant credits before broad crawling.

The selected optional Convex resources are:

- Convex AI Gateway as the primary OpenAI route;
- `openai/gpt-5.6-terra` for record extraction, consequence factors, and issue
  linking;
- `openai/gpt-5.6-luna` for discovery classification, ranking, independent
  publication review, and chat;
- pinned Convex Auth v2 alpha with Google OAuth;
- AgentMail verification for email-only alert subscriptions.

Phase 0 was completed on August 27:

- the Convex plugin is visible and enabled;
- the Firecrawl `CONVEXALLGAS` code added the advertised 20,000 participant
  credits;
- TanStack Start is configured in SPA/static-prerender mode;
- a Convex cloud development deployment exists and the static-hosting component
  is registered;
- the Phase 0 shell passed a hosted development smoke, then the matching backend
  and frontend were promoted to `https://befitting-flamingo-587.convex.site`;
- the product was renamed to Public Parish; `https://www.publicparish.com` was
  attached directly to the production HTTP router, and the bare domain was
  configured as a path-preserving redirect; the required `convex.site` URL
  remains public and functional;
- `npx convex ai-files install` completed and the generated guidelines were
  read;
- Convex Auth v2 is pinned to `2.0.0-alpha.1`; Google OAuth is configured and
  production sign-in and sign-out have passed on both public origins;
- every direct dependency is pinned to its resolved version, and production
  builds fail if `VITE_CONVEX_URL` is missing;
- generated agent guidance remains local and can be recreated with
  `npx convex ai-files install` instead of adding duplicate generated copies to
  the public repository;
- the live AI Gateway model list contains `openai/gpt-5.6-terra` and
  `openai/gpt-5.6-luna`;
- the team spending limits are a $20 warning threshold and $60 disable threshold
  per month;
- the public `LaykenV/public-parish` GitHub repository and matching `origin`
  remote exist, with the initial source commit published on `main`;
- the MIT license is present;
- `npm ci`, typechecking, three tests, the production build, lint, cloud Convex
  pushes, and local, hosted-development, and production readiness queries all
  pass;
- the public root, production-bound asset, direct not-found route, and desktop
  and mobile layouts were tested signed out.

The evidence backend through Slice 4, resident-interface Design Slices 1 through
8, and implementation Slices 6 through 9 are live in production. The final
build slice has production proof linked below.
Slice 1 was proven on the personal development deployment with the official
Lafayette council hub, an agenda PDF, and its minutes PDF. Slice 2 made real
`MODEL_STRONG` extraction calls through Convex AI Gateway and produced a private,
deterministically validated agenda candidate. PR #6 merged the reviewed Slice 2
backend as `74ce97e`; production workflow `33222925340` deployed it and passed
smoke. The real Terra extraction and replay ran in development, not production.
Slice 3 then ran a real independent Luna review in development. Luna rejected
two secondary fields, and the deterministic policy produced one limited
source-only version with three core citations. Replay made no second model call
or version. PR #12 merged as `8df651c`; production workflow `33261235916`
deployed the hardened Slice 3 backend and frontend, applied the registry seed,
and passed smoke.

Slice 4 deployed through PR #13 as `c162543`. Production workflow `33273984552`
and the independent production smoke passed. Real Lafayette agenda and minutes
records `CO-022-2026` and `CO-023-2026` retain separate decision histories in
the personal development deployment while linking into issue
`n57071y9n25rrs09yaanb1hz918dd1fs` through citations that name their shared
counterparty. Independent review accepted one public-assets consequence factor,
and code assigned 5 of 100 points. The issue keeps an earlier withheld version
whose weak importance rationale failed review. Replaying the accepted inputs
returned the same build without another model call or version.

On August 30, a controlled production onboarding stored eight current Lafayette
City Council PDFs without truncation. Terra extraction, deterministic
validation, independent Luna review, and publication produced full current
records for `CO-062-2026`, `CO-069-2026`, and `CO-072-2026`. The
board-vacancy announcement remained limited, and its unsupported zoned deadline
remained withheld. PRs #15 through #23 deployed the fixes found during the run.
The final suite passed 146 tests, typecheck, builds, prerender, and lint, and the
production workflow and independent smoke passed.

On August 31, the repeatable launch batch promoted 26 atomic records from 17
official PDFs whose production hashes matched the reviewed development inputs.
The batch produced 15 Lafayette, 9 Rapides, and 2 East Baton Rouge records: 15
full and 11 limited. One negative control returned `not_found`, three targets
stayed out after exact-citation failures, and replay reused all 27 successful
extraction run IDs. A one-time production-data correction then cleared the
current publication pointers from one older duplicate Lafayette board-vacancy
record without deleting its evidence. The resident query now returns 26
publications and exactly one board-vacancy card, under
`CITY-BOARD-APPLICATIONS-2026-09-15`. These records do not prove complete
government-body coverage.

PR #14 deployed the labeled low-fidelity route blueprint as `6e46fd7`. PR #24
then deployed the responsive application shell plus fixture-backed Home, For
You, and Explore as `4e2ac67`. Explicit fixture query scenarios remain available
for deterministic QA in development builds, but resident pages no longer show a
fixture banner. Production ignores fixture parameters and does not render those
records. PR #25 deployed the owner phone-review refinements as `b22e321`.
Verification passed 163 tests across 19 files, typecheck, production builds,
prerender, and lint. Production workflow `33324166404` and the independent
production smoke passed the direct Convex host, canonical domain, apex redirect,
and readiness query.

PR #26 deployed the bounded resident publication query and discovery
integration as `409a3e1`. At that checkpoint, no production issue build,
importance assessment, or ranked issue projection had run. Home, For You, and
Explore read current full and limited atomic publications, labeled them as
decision records, and opened the official source. Withheld publications stayed
hidden.

PR #27 deployed Design Slice 3 as `3a59e45`. It implements issue, atomic
decision, meeting, and citation-level evidence views against explicit
development fixtures. Production builds exclude those fixture modules and show
recovery pages until the real detail queries are connected. Workflow
`33332573558` and the independent production smoke passed.

PR #28 merged Design Slice 4 as `ff36c1b`. Production workflow `33389489990`
succeeded. PR #31 deployed Design Slice 5 as `adfe81e`. Production workflow
`33401768387` and the independent production smoke passed. The fixture-backed
follow, account-entry, preference, notification, and email-management interface
is deployed behind the honest production unavailable state.

PR #34 deployed Design Slice 6 as `0aa7474`. PR #37 deployed Design Slice 7 as
`f854c2e`. PR #43 deployed Design Slice 8 as `85d6947`, completing the resident
route hierarchy, responsive system, evidence interface, Ask, follow and email,
Coverage, accessibility pass, and connected prototype. Production workflow
`33454522729` and the independent production smoke passed. The final release
keeps all development fixtures out of production behavior and records the real
API owner for every fixture-backed action.

Anonymous visit and area-selection telemetry is live and private. A controlled
test proved the production writes and origin-specific browser accounting. It is
test traffic, not resident adoption.

The UI track, Slice 5 data gate, and implementation Slice 6 are complete.
Resident-safe decision, meeting, and issue projections map accepted
publications and exact citations into the finished routes, and the issue query
fails closed on stale decision links. PRs #45, #47, #49, #56, and #57 deployed
private 24-hour Agent threads, the high-reasoning selector and answer flow,
request-frequency limits, deterministic citation validation, and corrected
resident citation display. Controlled production tests proved related issue
turns, a corpus answer spanning two decisions, exact Source controls, evidence
not found, thread restoration, and answer prose without raw internal evidence
IDs. PRs #58 and #59 deployed Convex Auth v2 Google sessions, centralized
ownership, private saved areas and topics, and the public privacy notice. Real
production sign-in and sign-out passed on the canonical domain and from the
qualifying `convex.site` origin through the canonical callback. PRs #66 and #67
deployed Google and AgentMail-verified email follow enrollment, ownership,
preferences, and scoped management. Development proved real verification mail,
signed webhook handling, Google OAuth follow creation, cadence changes, mute,
resume, and removal. PRs #72 through #75 deployed durable notification matches,
deduplicated immediate email, weekly roundups, provider reconciliation, and live
notification settings. A controlled development replay matched every target
type, sent two immediate and two weekly AgentMail messages, and sent nothing on
replay. PRs #78 and #79 deployed grounded alert replies and private source
reports. PRs #81 through #83 hardened weekly reply scope, retained report
delivery results beyond provider cleanup, and stopped alerts after coverage
lapses. A controlled production report reached `sent` and started no evidence
pipeline run. The production alert-and-reply round trip and public coverage-request loop
were pending at that checkpoint and subsequently passed Slice 9 certification.
Recruited-resident proof, the demo, and submission remain separate work.

PRs #85 through #88 deployed the owner-controlled coverage compiler, bounded
Firecrawl discovery, strict source classification, exact-sample validation,
ten-gate evaluator, promotion controls, and private operations view. PR #91
completed the evidence lifecycle and production certification. Alexandria City
Council, Pineville City Council, Rapides Parish Police Jury, Baton Rouge
Metropolitan Council, and Baton Rouge Planning and Zoning Commission passed all ten gates
and were promoted. PR #92 connected the public selector to the live jurisdiction
status. Rapides and East Baton Rouge are available. Lafayette remains
validating because five planning bodies lack reachable meeting-specific agenda
and outcome evidence. Slice 9 added bounded scheduled checks and automatic
decision inventory, which were outside the Slice 8 compiler.

PR #70 then corrected Place follow validation so supported parishes and
municipalities use the same enrollment path while unsupported places still
fail closed. Pull-request checks, production workflow `33682483792`, and the
independent production smoke passed on merge commit `1ece03d`. This clears the
follow-target preflight for Slice 7C without adding alert delivery.

PRs #72 through #75 then deployed Slice 7C as `8ff1c79`, `d40983a`,
`ec08168`, and `6db32a3`. Production workflows `33706796984`, `33707795958`,
`33708562803`, and `33709247528` passed. An independent production smoke passed
after every merge. The controlled replay used project-owned addresses, not a
resident address, and validated the official source, app, and management links
in all four provider messages.

During the hackathon, branches use the local Vite frontend with the personal
Convex development deployment. There is no staging deployment. Pull requests
run the full verification command. A reviewed merge to `main` is the production
approval and deploys the matching Convex backend and static frontend, applies
the idempotent registry seed, and runs the production smoke. The development
`convex.site` upload remains available for changes that need a hosted check.

## Judging Map

### Everyday App

Judge question: can a normal person use this this week?

Public Parish proof:

- no account needed to browse or ask questions;
- choose a parish or municipality, not a technical data source;
- discover one current decision;
- understand it in plain language;
- inspect official receipts;
- follow it and receive the outcome.

Failure mode: a developer-facing crawler dashboard or a generic AI digest.

### Creativity and Usefulness

Judge question: is this a real product, and does it solve a recognizable problem?

Public Parish proof:

- connects fragmented official sources into issue timelines;
- makes public deadlines and later outcomes visible;
- combines search, anonymous chat, change tracking, and alerts;
- works on real Louisiana portal diversity;
- exposes uncertainty, source revisions, and a private problem-reporting path.

Failure mode: summarizing a PDF without a continuing resident workflow.

### Convex Depth

Judge question: does Convex do meaningful application work?

Public Parish proof:

- normalized schema and indexes;
- queries, mutations, internal functions, and actions;
- realtime issue and coverage updates;
- idempotent staged processing;
- schedules or crons for expected records;
- Convex Auth v2 alpha Google OAuth and user-owned follows;
- Convex AI Gateway calls attributed by project and function;
- file storage for evidence artifacts;
- registered Firecrawl, AgentMail, and static-hosting components;
- HTTP actions for provider callbacks, share routes, and health routes.

Failure mode: using Convex as a thin key-value store behind a mostly external
demo.

### Sponsor Integration

Judge question: do OpenAI, Firecrawl, and AgentMail do necessary work?

Public Parish proof:

- Firecrawl discovers, retrieves, parses, and versions difficult official
  sources;
- OpenAI through Convex AI Gateway performs strict Terra extraction,
  consequence-factor extraction, issue-link proposals, independent Luna review,
  and evidence-grounded answers;
- AgentMail sends and receives persistent issue threads and material-change
  alerts;
- all state and the visible realtime result live in Convex.

Failure mode: a sponsor API call that can be removed without changing the
resident outcome.

### Live App

Judge question: can judges and agents open and use it?

Public Parish proof:

- public `convex.site` URL;
- no invitation;
- useful signed-out path;
- demo data is real current public evidence;
- direct dynamic routes and official source links work.

### Social Proof

Judge question: did anyone care enough to use or engage with it?

Public Parish proof:

- real resident sessions;
- follows and substantive questions;
- return visits or alert opens;
- public technical build posts with sponsor tags;
- resident-facing posts and local distribution.

Do not substitute impressions for completed product actions.

### Demo

Judge question: does the video prove the product quickly?

Public Parish proof:

- under three minutes;
- little narration;
- real clicks;
- visible source citations;
- a live Convex update;
- a real AgentMail alert;
- a glimpse of dynamic coverage across different portals.

## Demo Storyboard

Target length: 2 minutes 45 seconds

### 0:00 to 0:15: The Resident Problem

Open Public Parish signed out. Select Lafayette and a topic. State one sentence:
local decisions are public, but spread across packets, portals, and updates.

### 0:15 to 0:45: Find What Matters

Show the issue-led Home and choose Lafayette. Open one accepted issue timeline.
Point to "Why this may matter," the latest official action, and its sources.

### 0:45 to 1:15: Inspect the Receipts

Move through the issue timeline. Open one citation to the exact official PDF page
or excerpt. Show last checked, source version, and a visible uncertainty or
limited state if appropriate.

### 1:15 to 1:40: Ask Without an Account

Ask a substantive anonymous follow-up. Show a multi-turn answer with citations.
Ask something the evidence does not contain if time permits and show the honest
not-found path.

### 1:40 to 2:10: Follow the Change

Sign in or use a prepared signed-in state, follow the issue, and run a clearly
identified current source update or deterministic replay. Show the issue change
live without refresh.

### 2:10 to 2:30: Receive the Outcome

Open the AgentMail message with the material change and source. Reply with a
question and show the persistent thread.

### 2:30 to 2:45: Prove the Platform

Show the coverage page with Lafayette, Rapides, and East Baton Rouge source
shapes. Briefly show one controlled internal compiler run that produced a source
registry. End on the resident promise, not a roadmap.

## User Proof Plan

Recruit before the app feels finished.

### First Five

- three Lafayette-area residents;
- two Alexandria/Pineville-area residents.

Ask each to:

1. select their location;
2. find a decision they recognize or care about;
3. inspect an official source;
4. ask a real question;
5. follow the issue if useful;
6. describe what they expected next.

### Submission Targets

- 25 real residents;
- 10 follows;
- 10 substantive questions;
- several return visits or alert opens;
- one issue followed through a later official outcome;
- zero unsupported published claims.

Capture aggregate event counts and anonymized quotes only with permission.
Never expose private chat, email addresses, or resident identities in the demo.

Report anonymous telemetry with its definition. `Unique visitors` means
distinct production browser identifiers within a 90-day active identity
window. `Activated visitors` means distinct browsers that selected at least one
supported area. `Returning visitors` means a later visit at least 24 hours
after first use. A browser returning after 90 inactive days can increment the
cumulative visitor total again. These counts do not prove a unique person or
Louisiana residency. A submission may call permissioned, known testers real
residents and should keep that count separate from anonymous browser totals.
The production endpoint checks its served origin and applies per-browser and
global rate limits, but a scripted client can still spoof anonymous traffic.
Describe these as product signals, not audited people.
Browsers that cannot persist and read back the random identifier are excluded
instead of being counted again on each reload.

The August 31 production check created a controlled baseline of 2 unique
browser identifiers, 2 visits, 1 activated visitor, and 1 Lafayette selection.
One tester created both identifiers by loading the canonical domain and the
required `convex.site` origin. Origin-specific browser storage makes those two
identifiers, not two people. Subtract this baseline from later organic totals or
disclose it with any submission count. Do not call it user or resident evidence.

## Social Plan

### X and LinkedIn

Post evidence of:

- the first immutable Lafayette snapshot after Slice 1;
- dynamic official-source discovery;
- an immutable source revision;
- strict extraction and independent review;
- a live Convex update;
- AgentMail thread behavior;
- the final public app and demo.

Tag all sponsors as required. Explain the resident outcome before technical
detail. Do not spend a checkpoint on the setup shell alone.

### TikTok and Facebook

Post:

- why residents miss local decisions;
- one real source-backed issue;
- how Public Parish shows the deadline and receipts;
- what changed after a meeting;
- an invitation to test the free tool through the issue's share URL.

Start resident-facing posts only after the thin resident proof exposes a real
public issue page. Reuse the technical recording with a resident-first edit.

Be transparent that the builder created it. Follow local group rules. Do not
frame the product as supporting or opposing CCS, a data center, SpaceX, or any
other contested project.

## Evidence to Save

- screenshots or recordings of live source changes;
- source URLs and hashes used in the demo;
- aggregate users, questions, follows, and return actions;
- email delivery proof with personal details hidden;
- public social links and visible engagement;
- passing test output near feature freeze;
- public repo and deployment timestamps;
- provider integration configuration that contains no secrets.

## Final Standard

No plan can promise a win. Public Parish earns a credible first-place attempt by
being more than large: it must be coherent, live, trusted, useful this week, and
easy to prove in under three minutes.


## Slice 9 completion

The final feature build is complete through Slice 9, with subsequent repairs
through PR #139. [Current build status and QA gates](build-status.md)
records release proof, exact supported bodies, automation limits, and remaining
work. [Production certification](slice-9-production-certification.md)
preserves the initial release evidence. The [bounded catch-up checkpoint](bounded-catchup-2026-09-07.md)
records the latest paid processing and the owner's $10 total maximum.

Proceed with the founder's full QA sweep. Limited beta follows a passing resident
loop and useful evidence for the first testers, with coverage limitations visible.
Full catch-up and all-body automatic updates are unfinished. An empty processing
queue is not required before QA. No Slice 10 is planned.
