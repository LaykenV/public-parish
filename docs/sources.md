# Official-Source Plan

Current status: Slice 9 is complete. See [build status and remaining work](build-status.md)
for the September 6 documentation checkpoint. Dated sections below retain their
original release context; they do not reopen completed feature work.

Status: all twelve launch bodies supported across Lafayette, Rapides, and East Baton Rouge.
Last verified: September 6, 2026

This document supplies starting points, not a claim of complete coverage. Every
URL must be checked during the Firecrawl source spike, and every public body must
pass the same gold-set and freshness gate before Public Parish marks it
supported.

## Current Lafayette source repair

The official event service recovered on September 6. Agenda attachments and
outcome links embedded inside agenda PDFs supplied the missing official evidence.
The v4 gold set records exact current and historical agenda/outcome pairs for
City Planning, Parish Planning, City Zoning, BOZA, and Hearing Examiner.
The [source investigation](source-spikes/lafayette-planning-recovery-2026-09-06.md)
records the observed URLs and document checks.

City Planning, Parish Planning, City Zoning, BOZA, and Hearing Examiner passed
all ten development and production gates. They joined the already supported
Lafayette City Council and Youngsville City Council. Lafayette is now available
for these seven named bodies. The five planning bodies need owner-started updates. Recovered representative samples do not prove
automatic discovery of future opaque attachments or PDF-embedded outcome links.

See the [source-operations report](source-operations-2026-09-06.md) for the exact
coverage, automation limits, and remaining catch-up. The checkpoints below retain
their dated historical findings.

## Implemented checkpoint

Slice 1 seeded the Lafayette City Council registry with the council hub,
document search, and schedule/research URLs. The first checked gold set covered
four agendas, three corresponding minutes, and one ordinance packet.

The August 31 launch batch promoted 26 cited atomic records from 17 official
PDFs whose production content hashes matched the reviewed development inputs.
The result is 15 Lafayette, 9 Rapides, and 2 East Baton Rouge records. Fifteen
are full and 11 are limited. One Rapides negative control returned `not_found`,
three targets stayed out after repeat exact-citation failures, and replay reused
all 27 successful extraction run IDs without new model calls. The batch evidence
lives in `docs/production-batches/launch-data-2026-08-31.v1.json`.

At that checkpoint, the resident query exposed those 26 publications. A September 1 one-time
production data correction cleared the current publication pointers from one
older duplicate Lafayette board-vacancy record without deleting its evidence.
Exactly one board-vacancy card remains, under
`CITY-BOARD-APPLICATIONS-2026-09-15`. The duplicate was a legacy projection
defect, not another launch record.

The August 31 proof covers selected official PDF source families. It did not by
itself mark a government body supported. Slice 8 later ran exact checked
artifacts through retrieval, extraction, deterministic validation, independent
review, publication, a missing-record probe, paired agenda and minutes replay,
and production source-link checks. Production promoted Alexandria City Council,
Pineville City Council, Rapides Parish Police Jury, Baton Rouge Metropolitan
Council, and Baton Rouge Planning and Zoning Commission after each passed all ten gates.
That makes Rapides and East Baton Rouge supported in the resident selector.

At the September 4 checkpoint, Lafayette City Council and Youngsville City
Council had passed gates 1 through 9 in development and were not yet promoted.
Slice 9 subsequently promoted both bodies. The planning sources remained
blocked at the September 5 checkpoint. Government pages and schedule PDFs
answered, but the event service returned 502 and meeting-specific evidence was
missing. The September 6 recovery above resolved that source failure and passed
the unchanged production gates.

## Source Policy

Public Parish publishes from primary government records:

- agendas and meeting packets;
- minutes;
- ordinances and resolutions;
- planning and zoning agendas, results, and case packets;
- official meeting calendars and notices;
- official contract or spending material contained in supported proceedings;
- official video links as supporting references, not an initial transcription
  corpus.

News, advocacy sites, social posts, and search snippets can help a person notice
an issue, but they are not publication evidence. Evidence retrieval stays inside
registered official domains and approved government document hosts.

## Initial Registry Seeds

The LCG council hub states the normal first-and-third-Tuesday pattern and that
regular-meeting agendas are published shortly before meetings. Treat September
1 and September 15 as target live cycles only after the official 2026 schedule
and posted agenda confirm them.

Planning and zoning documents may appear as calendar PDFs under the LCG document
host. Discovery should still find the current pattern. The certification gold
set pins exact public examples so a classifier cannot substitute an unrelated
LCG document.

As of September 4, 2026, the planning body pages, main LCG calendar, and 2026
schedule PDFs answer 200. Search indexes still describe planning agendas and
action summaries at former LCG document paths, while current meeting-detail
links route through the LCG events service, which returns 502. Schedules prove
cadence, not decisions or outcomes. Keep the affected bodies unavailable until
stable current and historical agenda and outcome artifacts pass the same checks
as every other body.

Youngsville's city page embeds its current agendas, packets, and minutes from
Municode. The checked source boundary therefore includes only the Youngsville
publish page and its `youngsvila-pubu` document path. A broad Municode host is
not an official source for this body.

### Rapides Parish

The Rapides source spike must explicitly catch stale index pages. A page titled
"Agendas" is not proof that the listing is current. Expected-meeting schedules,
document dates, and linked file versions must agree.

Pineville's old `/egov/documents/` PDF addresses now return 404. Its city
document center redirects council records to Pineville's MuniDocs collection.
Certification uses the collection's exact Pineville product and document IDs.

### East Baton Rouge Parish

The CivicEngage agenda centers expose revised or previous versions. They are a
strong test of the immutable snapshot and visible-change model.

## Registry Output Contract

The source compiler should turn the seeds into a checked record resembling:

```json
{
  "jurisdiction": "Lafayette Parish",
  "body": "Lafayette City Council",
  "officialDomains": ["lafayettela.gov", "apps.lafayettela.gov"],
  "sourceKinds": [
    {
      "kind": "agenda",
      "discoveryUrl": "official URL",
      "expectedCadence": "meeting_cycle"
    },
    {
      "kind": "minutes",
      "discoveryUrl": "official URL",
      "expectedCadence": "meeting_cycle"
    }
  ],
  "discoveryMode": "dynamic",
  "status": "validating"
}
```

The compiler stores why a domain is official, representative documents, the
date window it tested, and every failed expectation. It does not activate a
body from a model's classification alone.

## Firecrawl Playbook

For each candidate body:

1. Map the official root and candidate source pages.
2. Search the official domain for agenda, minutes, ordinance, resolution,
   planning, zoning, meeting, hearing, notice, and packet patterns.
3. Retrieve current list pages and representative documents.
4. Render or interact when a client-side portal hides links.
5. Parse PDFs with page boundaries and OCR flags.
6. Record canonical and redirected URLs.
7. Hash every artifact and compare repeat retrievals.
8. Identify document-version behavior, including overwritten files.
9. Define expected cadence from an official schedule where possible.
10. Propose the source registry and run the gold set.

Use the Firecrawl agent only for source onboarding, structural change, or repair.
Once the registry is stable, use targeted operations and change tracking to
control cost and improve determinism.

## Gold Set

Create a checked-in, metadata-only manifest of exact public representative
artifacts. Store each URL, body, artifact type, date role, expected cadence, and
the record ID used for extraction. The compiler may add discovery candidates
around that set, but it may not substitute a model-selected URL for a required
sample. Missing artifacts remain failed requirements. Do not copy private data
or huge generated output into Git.

For each launch body, collect when available:

- two recent agendas or meeting packets;
- two corresponding minutes or results;
- one ordinance, resolution, or official decision artifact;
- one revised, amended, postponed, or canceled item;
- one item with a date;
- one item with a monetary amount;
- one item with a public deadline or hearing;
- for planning bodies, two case or zoning records;
- one negative example that must not become a substantive decision.

For final source certification, hand-label:

- artifact type and official body;
- expected meeting date;
- atomic decisions;
- names, amounts, deadlines, votes, and lifecycle state;
- exact page or excerpt supporting each fact;
- expected links between records;
- expected importance factors;
- facts that must remain unknown.

## Coverage Gate

A body becomes publicly supported only when:

1. every exact representative artifact in the checked manifest is retrieved;
2. the source registry uses only checked official hosts and document paths;
3. current and historical records can be separated;
4. every accepted material fact resolves to a source citation;
5. no unsupported name, date, amount, vote, deadline, or status is published;
6. source changes or a record's agenda-to-outcome update create immutable
   snapshots and publication versions;
7. an incomplete or failed source becomes limited or withheld;
8. an expected schedule can detect stale or missing coverage;
9. successful agenda and minutes runs for the same record both fall within the
   last 60 days;
10. every representative official source URL answers when checked from the
    production backend.

All public regions use this gate. There is no lower "beta" evidence standard.

## Promotion Gate

Coverage and promotion are different.

- A record can be valid and searchable without appearing in a main feed.
- Consequence ranking uses cited factors.
- Completeness becomes visible confidence.
- A consequential item with limited material can be promoted with a limited
  label if its importance itself is supported.
- A routine ceremonial or procedural item stays searchable but is not promoted.

## Freshness Expectations

The source registry should generate checks from official schedules:

- before the expected agenda publication window;
- at the expected publication window;
- before a hearing or meeting;
- after the meeting for minutes, results, vote, or updated packet;
- on a slower cadence for ordinances, implementation, and completed outcomes.

When no schedule is known, use a conservative daily or weekly check and mark the
expectation as inferred. The coverage page distinguishes official expectations
from inferred ones.

## First Backend Test Order

1. Lafayette council hub and document search
2. one Lafayette current agenda and one corresponding outcome
3. Lafayette planning/zoning packet
4. Youngsville current and archived records
5. Alexandria council
6. Pineville document center
7. Rapides Police Jury, including stale-page detection
8. Baton Rouge Metro Council version history
9. Planning and Zoning Commission in Baton Rouge

This order establishes the local demo first, then tests different portal shapes
before Public Parish claims geographic breadth.


## Slice 9 completion

The final feature build is complete and deployed through the follow-up repairs
in PRs #102 through #108. [Current build status and remaining work](build-status.md)
records the exact release, verification scope, named coverage, and operating
limits. [Production certification](slice-9-production-certification.md)
preserves the initial release evidence. The [September 6 source-operations
report](source-operations-2026-09-06.md) records subsequent certification,
automation, queue progress, and budget limits. Catch-up, future planning-source
automation, resident observations, the demo, and submission remain operating
work. No Slice 10 is planned.
